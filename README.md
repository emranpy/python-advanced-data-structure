## Introduction

This repository provides a collection of Python implementations for various advanced data structures. It aims to explain the concepts behind each data structure and demonstrate their usage through clear and concise examples. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Python developer, this repository will help you deepen your understanding of advanced data structures and their applications.

## Data Structures Covered

The repository covers the following advanced data structures:

1. Array
2. AVL Trees
3. Red-Black Trees
4. B-Trees
5. Heaps and Priority Queues
6. Graphs and Graph Algorithms
7. Trie
8. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
9. Segment Trees
10. Fenwick Trees (Binary Indexed Trees)
11. Bloom Filters
12. Suffix Trees
13. Linked Lists
14. Queues and Stacks
15. Deques
16. NamedTuples
17. DefaultDict

Each data structure is organized in its own directory, containing a Python implementation file, relevant examples, and explanations of its operations and algorithms.
